# TextUtils - Text Converter App (My First React App)

I am learning React from the CodeWithHarry YouTube channel, and this is my first project! The **TextUtils** app is a text converter application that offers several useful features to interact with text.

## Features
- **Convert text to uppercase**
- **Convert text to lowercase**
- **Clear text**
- **Copy text to clipboard**
- **Dark mode for a better user experience**
- **Accordion feature for improved UI**

## Project Status
This project is currently **in progress**. 

## Future Plans
In the future, I plan to add more functionality to the app, including:
- **Word and character count** features
- A separate **About Us** page (although there is currently an **About Us** link in the navbar)
- Moving the accordion feature to the About page
- Adding more functions based on feedback and learning

## Tech Stack
- **HTML** (for structure)
- **CSS** (for styling)
- **JavaScript** (for functionality)
- **React** (for building the app)
- **Bootstrap** (for responsive design and styling)
