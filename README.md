I am learning React from the CodeWithHarry YouTube channel, and this is my first project! The TextUtils app is a text converter application that offers several useful features to interact with text.

## Features

- Convert text to uppercase
- Convert text to lowercase
- Clear text
- Copy text to clipboard
- Dark mode for a better user experience
- Accordion feature for improved UI

## Project Status

This project is currently in progress.

## Future Plans

In the future, I plan to add more functionality to the app, including:

- Word and character count features
- A separate About Us page (although there is currently an About Us link in the navbar)
- Moving the accordion feature to the About page
- Adding more functions based on feedback and learning

## Tech Stack

- **HTML** (for structure)
- **CSS** (for styling)
- **JavaScript** (for functionality)
- **React** (for building the app)
